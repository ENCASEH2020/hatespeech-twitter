# Hate and Abusive Speech on Twitter

Repository for "Large Scale Crowdsourcing and Characterization of Twitter Abusive Behavior" paper, published in ICWSM 2018. Full text of the paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.00393.pdf). All updates on this public dataset can be found in this repository.

The dataset provided here includes an updated version of the original dataset, with ~100k tweets annotated using the CrowdFlower platform: 
* hatespeech_labels.csv: contains ~100k rows, where every row is consisted of a unique Tweet ID and its according majority annotation

UPDATE: 
It has come to our understanding that a number of the tweets are not available anymore for download on Twitter. We are happy to provide one more file with the full 100k tweet text and their associated majority labels. The tweets are shuffled so that there is no connection between tweet IDs and texts (in order to be aligned with the T&C of Twitter). To obtain the file please visit [this Zenodo page](https://zenodo.org/record/3706866#.YjzZfDUReUk).
